# Trend Over Time

The number of airplane crashes peaked during the mid-20th century and has steadily declined over the yearsâ€”likely due to advances in aviation technology and safety regulations.

# Fatalities Distribution
Most crashes involve fewer than 50 fatalities. The fatality distribution is heavily right-skewed with a few extremely fatal incidents.

# Operators with Most Crashes:
A small number of airline operators are responsible for a large proportion of crashes, suggesting high-risk carriers or greater operational volume.

# Statistical Analysis:

Mean Fatalities per Crash: ~8.6

Median Fatalities: 0

Standard Deviation: ~18.5

A T-test comparing two post-1950 decades was conducted to evaluate if the mean number of fatalities significantly changed. The p-value indicates if that change is statistically significant.

### Descriptive Statistics:
| Metric         | Temperature | Pressure  | Chemical Concentration |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Mean           | ~19.98°C    | ~1013 hPa | ~4.99 mol/L             |
| Standard Dev.  | ~3.57       | ~14.20    | ~1.44                   |
| Range          | 13.9 – 26.0 | 990 – 1035| 2.56 – 7.49             |

### Correlation Analysis:
- **Very weak correlations** were observed:
  - Temperature ↔ Pressure: 0.007
  - Temperature ↔ Chemical: -0.003
  - Pressure ↔ Chemical: -0.0008

### Visual Insights

- **Time-Series Plots**: Showed periodic trends in temperature (sinusoidal) and pressure (cosine).
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlighted negligible inter-variable relationships.
- **Pairplot**: Confirmed low visual correlation across all variable pairs.
- **FFT Plots**:
  - Temperature and pressure showed strong low-frequency signals.
  - Chemical concentration had more frequent oscillations.

### Conclusion

1. **Independent Variables**: No strong statistical relationships among the variables.
2. **Clear Periodicity**: Fourier analysis confirmed sinusoidal sources.
3. **Effective Normalization**: Prepared the data well for cross-variable analyses.
4. **Model-Ready Features**: Well-defined, non-overlapping trends make the dataset suitable for signal decomposition, forecasting, or machine learning applications.

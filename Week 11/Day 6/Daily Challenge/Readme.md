# ðŸ§ª Daily Challenge: Advanced Data Analysis and Problem Solving

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This challenge involved simulating and analyzing a scientific experiment dataset with multiple time-series variables: **Temperature**, **Pressure**, and **Chemical Concentration**, measured over a consistent time interval.

## ðŸ§¬ Dataset Description

- **Entries:** 1000 time points
- **Variables:**
  - `Temperature`: Simulated with sinusoidal trends and noise
  - `Pressure`: Cosine-based periodic behavior with added noise
  - `Chemical Concentration`: Higher-frequency sine wave with moderate noise
- Data was generated using NumPy and stored in a Pandas DataFrame.

## ðŸ”§ Data Transformations

- **Normalization** was performed using the Z-score method:
  - Centered data to zero mean and unit standard deviation
  - Facilitated fair comparison and frequency analysis
- **Fourier Transformation (FFT):**
  - Revealed dominant frequency components for each variable
  - Validated underlying periodic patterns in time-series signals

## ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics:
| Metric         | Temperature | Pressure  | Chemical Concentration |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Mean           | ~19.98Â°C    | ~1013 hPa | ~4.99 mol/L             |
| Standard Dev.  | ~3.57       | ~14.20    | ~1.44                   |
| Range          | 13.9 â€“ 26.0 | 990 â€“ 1035| 2.56 â€“ 7.49             |

### Correlation Analysis:
- **Very weak correlations** were observed:
  - Temperature â†” Pressure: 0.007
  - Temperature â†” Chemical: -0.003
  - Pressure â†” Chemical: -0.0008

ðŸ’¡ **Interpretation:** Each variable behaves independently â€” ideal for isolated signal studies.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Insights

- **Time-Series Plots**: Showed periodic trends in temperature (sinusoidal) and pressure (cosine).
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlighted negligible inter-variable relationships.
- **Pairplot**: Confirmed low visual correlation across all variable pairs.
- **FFT Plots**:
  - Temperature and pressure showed strong low-frequency signals.
  - Chemical concentration had more frequent oscillations.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

1. **Independent Variables**: No strong statistical relationships among the variables.
2. **Clear Periodicity**: Fourier analysis confirmed sinusoidal sources.
3. **Effective Normalization**: Prepared the data well for cross-variable analyses.
4. **Model-Ready Features**: Well-defined, non-overlapping trends make the dataset suitable for signal decomposition, forecasting, or machine learning applications.
